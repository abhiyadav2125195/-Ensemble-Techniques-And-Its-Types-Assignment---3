    " A Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family and is used for regression tasks. It is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm, which is primarily designed for classification. In Random Forest Regression, multiple decision trees are trained on different subsets of the training data, and the predictions of these individual trees are aggregated to make a final prediction for the target variable. It is a powerful and flexible algorithm used for tasks where the target variable is continuous, such as predicting house prices, stock prices, or any numerical value."

    " Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees through a process known as ensemble averaging. When making predictions, each decision tree in the forest independently predicts the target variable based on the input features. The final prediction is computed as the average (or weighted average) of these individual tree predictions for regression tasks. This aggregation of predictions helps in improving the accuracy and generalization of the model."
